# Welcome To ForkIt. 

ForkIt is an experimental SSR React app, currently in process.

## Story 
- Essentially built to provide a solution to my wife's kitchen problem: (not really a problem, but well..)
1. Library for her recipes.
2. Track the last time she cooked the recipe
3. Add/Remove recipes

I decided to experiment. Expand the app beyond the above mentioned needs, and enable kind-of-a social place for users to share recipes, see most used/liked recipes etc.

For learning purposes, I implement Server-Side Rendering with React on the front-end and Express on the backend, suplemented with GraphQL, Apollo and MongoDB for data storage and querying.
